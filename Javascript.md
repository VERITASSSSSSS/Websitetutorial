### **-    How do you declare a variable?**

Variable means anything that can *vary*. 
In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.

Use the reserved keyword `var` to declare a variable in JavaScript.

**Syntax**
   
 ``` java
 var <_variable-name_>;
 var <_variable-name_> = <_value_>;
```

   **Example: Variable Declaration**
   ```java
var msg; // declaring a variable without assigning a value
```

**Example: Variable Initialization**
```java
var msg; 
msg = "Hello JavaScript!"; // assigned a string value
alert(msg); // access a variable

//the following declares and assign a numeric value
var num = 100; 
var hundred = num;  // assigned a variable to varible
```
**Example: Multiple Variables**

```java
var one = 1, two = 'two', three;

//Output
1
two
undefined
```
