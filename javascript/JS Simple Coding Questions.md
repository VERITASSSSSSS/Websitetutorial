# The Odin Project 
1.  Write a function called  `add7`  that takes one number and returns that number + 7.


2.  Write a function called  `multiply`  that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.


3.  Write a function called  `capitalize`  that takes a string and returns that string with  _only_  the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.


4.  Write a function called  `lastLetter`  that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
    1.  `lastLetter("abcd")`  should return  `"d"`
