# The Odin Project 
1.  Write a function called  `add7`  that takes one number and returns that number + 7.


2.  Write a function called  `multiply`  that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.


3.  Write a function called  `capitalize`  that takes a string and returns that string with  _only_  the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.


4.  Write a function called  `lastLetter`  that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
    1.  `lastLetter("abcd")`  should return  `"d"`

5. Make a keyless car
```java
var age =  prompt("How old are you?");
if(Number(age)<18){
alert("Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off.");}
else  if(Number(age)===18){
alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");}
else  alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");
```
