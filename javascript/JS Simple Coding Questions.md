# The Odin Project 
1.  Write a function called  `add7`  that takes one number and returns that number + 7.
	```java
	function  add7(){
	let num =  prompt("Enter a number: ");
	alert(Number(num)+7);19
	}
	add7();
	```

2.  Write a function called  `multiply`  that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.

```java
function  multiply(){
let num1 =  prompt("Enter the first number: ");
let num2 =  prompt("Enter the second number: ");
alert("Your number is "+num1*num2);
}
```

4.  Write a function called  `capitalize`  that takes a string and returns that string with  _only_  the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.


5.  Write a function called  `lastLetter`  that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:

6.  `lastLetter("abcd")`  should return  `"d"`

7. Make a keyless car
	```java
	var age =  prompt("How old are you?");
	if(Number(age)<18){
	alert("Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off.");}
	else  if(Number(age)===18){
	alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");}
	else  alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");
	```
